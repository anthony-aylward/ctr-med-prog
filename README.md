# Center for Medical Progress and UCSD

On May 14, 2019 the anti-abortion nonprofit [Center for Medical Progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Medical_Progress) (CMP) published a [tweet](https://twitter.com/CtrMedProgress/status/1128473861387902977) with a link to a PDF containing an email conversation
between CMP and a scientist at a UCSD genetics and genomics lab. The tweet
claims:

The tweet and emails have been cited in articles on pro-life news outlets [lifesitenews.com](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/government-funded-laboratory-seeks-to-buy-baby-body-parts-from-almost-anyone)
and [liveaction.org](https://www.liveaction.org/news/university-lab-mistake-fetal-body-pro-life/).

After some digging into CMP's history, I now believe that CMP's
objective is a significant defunding of research at UCSD and that being
targeted by CMP is a threat to the health and safety of UCSD researchers. This
document outlines the evidence supporting that conclusion.

## A brief history of CMP

CMP was founded in 2013 by [long-time](http://www.rightwingwatch.org/post/the-radical-history-behind-the-center-for-medical-progress-sham-planned-parenthood-investigation/) pro-life activist [David Daleiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Daleiden). It became widely known in the summer of 2015 after releasing [heavily edited
videos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Daleiden) of conversations with
[Planned Parenthood](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=22&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjB8qSou63iAhVjHTQIHQnWBF4QFjAVegQIAxAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPlanned_Parenthood&usg=AOvVaw0TOcAkb6mBuSHyki2cPsUD) (PP) employees, and claiming ([falsely](https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2015/12/17/misinformer-of-the-year-the-center-for-medical/207506)) that PP profited from
the sale of fetal tissue. Multiple legal conflicts between CMP and PP ensued,
including [15 felony charges](https://apnews.com/c50e993d047142cf8ca0e8050daf6114)
in 2017 (and still ongoing) by the State of California against Daleiden and CMP employee Sandra
Merritt, in addition to a [civil suit](https://www.courthousenews.com/anti-abortionist-cant-duck-planned-parenthood-lawsuit/) against CMP by PP.

Current CMP board members include David Daleiden, [Troy Newman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy_Newman_(activist)), and [Albin Rhomberg.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albin_Rhomberg)

### Aftermath of the Planned Parenthood controversy

The videos released by CMP had substantial scientific and political impact.
Legislation to end federal funding for PP was [proposed but not passed](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-plannedparenthood/senate-blocks-planned-parenthood-defunding-measure-idUSKCN0Q80DL20150803) within months of the videos' release. Shortly thereafter, California-based fetal tissue
provider StemExpress [cut ties](https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-mh-a-partner-bails-on-planned-parenthood-20150817-column.html) with PP
under political pressure, [stymieing](https://web.archive.org/web/20161206191756/https://selectpaneldems-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/REVISED_FINAL_2.5.2016--ENTIRE%20REPORT-2.pdf)
research on various human disesases. CMP [targeted another provider](http://www.centerformedicalprogress.org/2018/09/cmp-issues-special-report-on-advanced-bioscience-resources/), Advanced
Bioscience Resources, in 2018.

## CMP's relationship with violent extremism

In late August 2015, Southern Poverty Law Center reported that CMP is [directly
connected](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2015/08/31/group-attacking-planned-parenthood-linked-extremists) to [Operation Rescue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Rescue_(Kansas)), another anti-abortion organisation whose members are
historically connected with violent extremism and domestic terrorism. Indeed,
a surge of reported threats against abortion providers followed the release of
CMP's videos.

On November 27, 2015, a [mass shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_Planned_Parenthood_shooting) occurred in a Planned Parenthood clinic
in Colorado Springs, Colorado, resulting in the deaths of three people and
injuries to nine. When the shooter was arrested, he reportedly ranted to police
about ["baby parts"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/abortion-rights-groups-political-rhetoric-contributed-to-shooting/2015/11/29/d2fad2c4-96c7-11e5-8917-653b65c809eb_story.html?utm_term=.d8fa2e9453d3).
Pro-choice and public health groups [called on the US Department of Justice](https://www.thenation.com/article/abortion-domestic-terrorism/)
to investigate this attack and others as acts of domestic terrorism, claiming the shooter had been motivated by the videos realeased by CMP. The
Colorado Springs shooting was the most recent and deadly of a decades-long
history of [anti-abortion killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-abortion_violence#Murders).

These facts demonstrate, at a minimum, that CMP's audience includes people
willing to perform acts of violence and terrorism in the name of pro-life
ideology.

> Acts of right-wing domestic terrorism have occurred in southern California in the past. The [2014 Islat Vista killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Isla_Vista_killings) were motivated by the perpetrator's [hatred of women](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43892189) and radicalization in [alt-right online communities](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-isle-vista-massacre-alt-right-20180206-story.html). The [2019 Poway
synagogue shooting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poway_synagogue_shooting), which occurred just 20 miles from UCSD, was motivated by the perpetrator's [anti-semitism](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/anti-semitic-open-letter-posted-online-under-name-chabad-synagogue-n999211) and radicalization on the neo-nazi forum [8chan](https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2019/04/28/ignore-the-poway-synagogue-shooters-manifesto-pay-attention-to-8chans-pol-board/). Far-right radicals in southern California have access to weapons and can be incited to violence by online activity.
